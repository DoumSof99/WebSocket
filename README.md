# WebSocket
- how to write a simple WebSocket locally in js, both the client and server side.
- how to upload the server into a cloud, share it, and use it on the open web.
- create a ball animation game and connect to the glitch server.

1) in the vs code I open the server-echo project and in the PowerShell, I go to this path and run:

2) That means the server started, and I can open this WebSocket Client (Chrome extension): chrome-extension://gobngblklhkgmjhbpbdlkglbhhlafjnh/index.html
3) In 2 tabs, I can see the messages passed from one client sent to the server, and the server sends this to every other client.

5) now that a simple client is created in the js we can call and receive messages from one client to the server and to the other client.

7) By connection to the site Glitch, it can host and share the project online https://glitch.com/dashboard, add the server there, and correct some things, finally, it does what it was doing before but it can be shared.
8) My project: https://websocket-server-echo-project.glitch.me

9) In the p5.js, I created a ball game where it follows the mouse click here: https://editor.p5js.org/DoumSof99/sketches/3BhfYq67G
10) In the vs code install the p5.js and the live server. By adding some code the ball game client is connected with the server on the glitch.

12) Created a new project in the Glitch (Website), named it ball-game-sync, then deleted everything from the files and copied - pasted mine. So now the ball game is hosted on the Glitch or static. (https://glitch.com/edit/#!/ball-game-sync)
