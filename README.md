# WebSocket_ClientSide
how to write a simple WebSocket client in C# using the WebSocketSharp library.

1) in the vs code I open the server-echo project and in the PowerShell, I go to this path and run:

2) That means the server started, and I can open this WebSocket Client (Chrome extension): chrome-extension://gobngblklhkgmjhbpbdlkglbhhlafjnh/index.html
3) In 2 tabs, I can see the messages passed from one client sent to the server, and the server sends this to every other client.

5) now that a simple client is created in the js we can call and receive messages from one client to the server and to the other client.

7) By connection to the site Glitch, it can host and share the project online https://glitch.com/dashboard, add the server there, and correct some things, finally, it does what it was doing before but it can be shared.
